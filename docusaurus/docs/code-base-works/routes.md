# Routes

## Location

The core dashboard routes are defined in `shell/nuxt/router.js`.


## Notes
This file was generated by nuxt and will soon be redefined by hand. It's safe to add new routes to this file.

## Pattern 
First instantiate a page component at the top of the file. Then define a new route at the bottom of the file by giving the page component a unique path and name
```js
const about = () => interopDefault(import('../pages/about.vue'))
...
{
    path: "/about",
    component: about,
    name: "about"
}
...
```
